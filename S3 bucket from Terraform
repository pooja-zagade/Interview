# Explanation 
-The provider "aws" block defines which cloud provider and region to use.
-The resource "aws_s3_bucket" block actually creates the S3 bucket.
-The bucket argument gives a unique name to the bucket.
-The acl sets permissions — here it’s private.
-The tags help identify and manage the resource easily in AWS.

resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "versioning" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket.id

  versioning_configuration {
    status = "Enabled"
  }
}
This enables versioning, so if any object is modified or deleted, previous versions are retained
